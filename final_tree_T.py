    connecting each vertex (from V \ V(T_H)) to the current tree T1 via the shortest path.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    G : networkx.Graph
        The original weighted, undirected graph. Each edge must have a 'weight' attribute.
    T_H : networkx.Graph
        The Steiner tree (subgraph of G) computed from the previous algorithm.
    
    Returns:
    --------
    T_final : networkx.Graph
        A tree that spans all vertices of G.
